###### Definition
### There isn't a single definition

>Is more like a coding style besides language features

---

###### Definition
### 3 basic concepts

* Immutability
* First Class Function
* Oriented a values, not names

---

###### Why?!
### Why are we talking about functional programming now?

---

###### Why?!
### Most popular functional p.l.

###### Why?!
### Like containers, is definetely a old thing.

> Why we only talking about it on the last years?

---

###### Why?!
### In general, is slow

* Is less efficient that a mutable way, like C or Java
* The computers used to be less powerful
* The preference was to a coding style that is more friendly with computer resources

---

###### Why?!
### The hardware revolution

###### Why?!
### The free lunch is over
####(Herb Sutter - 2005)
> Stated that microprocessor serial-processing speed is reaching a physical limit, which leads to two main consequences:

* Processor manufacturers will focus on products that better support multithreading (such as multi-core processors)
* Software developers will be forced to develop massively multithreaded programs as a way to better use such processors.

###### Why?!
### Vertical scaling

### How we increase the efficiency of a software to have a less waste the hardware resources?

* Using the principles of functional programming
* Functional programming languages offers better tools to work with concurrency
* Delivery business value
