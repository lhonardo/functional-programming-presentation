### There isn't a single definition

>Is more like a coding style besides language features

---

### 3 basic concepts

* Immutability
* First Class Function
* Oriented a values, not names

---

### Why are we talking about functional programming now?

### Most popular functional p.l.

### Is definetely a old thing.

> Why it is becoming more popular?

---

### In general, is slow

* Is less efficient than a mutable way, like C or Java
* In the past, computers hardwares used to be less powerful
* The preference was to a paradigm more friendly to limited computer resources

### The free lunch is over
#### (Herb Sutter - 2005)

> "Concurrency is the next major revolution in how we write software"
> Stated that microprocessor serial-processing speed is reaching a physical limit, which leads to two main consequences:

---

### The free lunch is over

* Processor manufacturers will focus on products that better support multithreading (such as multi-core processors)
* Software developers will be forced to develop massively multithreaded programs as a way to better use such processors.

### Vertical scaling
### How we increase the efficiency of a software to have a less waste the hardware resources?

* Using the principles of functional programming
* Functional programming languages offers better tools to work with concurrency
* Delivery business value
